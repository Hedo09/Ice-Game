Where to find...
- **the documentation**: In the "bugyi" folder *(on the master branch)*
- **the skeleton release**: You could find it as the last version on the skeleton branch or as a commit merged into master, but the **easiest** way to find it is as a release *(Releases tab at the top)*
- **the Intellij project (of any version of the game)**: In the src folder *(If you clone the repo, you can import it in Intellij, but you might have to set the SDK to yours, as we are doing the same, mixing OpenJDK and Oracle)*

and you can find the **text files** *(.puml)* of some of the **diagrams** in the diagrams folder.
If you want to open these, you can use, for example, https://www.planttext.com/
